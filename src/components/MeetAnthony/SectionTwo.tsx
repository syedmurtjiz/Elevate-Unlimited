A special thank you to my parents for always believing in me and supporting my dreams. Your love and encouragement have been my guiding light. I also want to express my deepest gratitude to one of my best friends, David McAlorum. David opened my eyes to the world of energy and spirituality, and has stood by my side through every step of my weight loss and spiritual journey. Your friendship and wisdom have been invaluable, and I am forever grateful.
